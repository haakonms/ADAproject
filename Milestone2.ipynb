    "# Twitter trolls - how Russia meddles with western democracies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Over the last several years there has been an attempt from Russian trolls to spread propaganda and fake news over social media in order to spread political ideas among the general population both nationally and internationally. Can these attempts be regarded as undermining the democracy of the affected countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to analyze a great number of these russian tweets and look into their motivations for this meddling. We will mainly look into their overall political goals in the US, and examine how these goals change over time. Have the trolls achieved their goals? We will also look into how the trolls operate and organize themselves, trying to find patterns in the madness. Such patterns can hopefully help the general population to indicate that a tweet is originating from a troll. As the Russian efforts are increasing every year, a solution is needed to defend the democracy.\n",

    "The data sets are of different shape and quality. The first one, provided by two researchers from Clemson University has already been preprocessed a bit. The second one is still quite raw, even though it has certain features as for example language. We have been cleaning some of it, and also processing and enriching to make new data frames that we want to use in our analysis.\n",

    "- external_author_id | An author account ID from Twitter \n",
    "- author | The handle sending the tweet\n",
    "- content | The text of the tweet\n",
    "- region | A region classification based on following criterias:\n",
    "     - 1. Geographical coordinates\n",
    "     - 2. Location listed in the user's profile\n",
    "     - 3. Time zone set by the user in their Twitter account settings.\n",
    "- language | The language of the tweet\n",
    "- publish_date | The date and time the tweet was sent\n",
    "- harvested_date | The date and time the tweet was collected by Social Studio\n",
    "- following | The number of accounts the handle was following at the time of the tweet\n",
    "- followers | The number of followers the handle had at the time of the tweet\n",
    "- updates | The number of “update actions” on the account that authored the tweet, including tweets, retweets and likes\n",
    "- post_type | Indicates if the tweet was a retweet or a quote-tweet\n",
    "- account_type | Specific account theme, as coded by Linvill and Warren\n",
    "- retweet | A binary indicator of whether or not the tweet is a retweet\n",

    "### 1.1.1) Loading the first dataset\n",
    "We loaded the 9 files into a unified dataframe. We decided to use pandas, since the dataset is not too large, and especially with the fact that we will be focusing on subsets of these tweets."
