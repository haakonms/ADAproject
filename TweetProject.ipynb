    "# Twitter trolls - how Russia meddles with western democracies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "Over the last several years there has been an attempt from Russian trolls to spread propaganda and fake news over social media in order to spread political ideas among the general population both nationally and internationally. Can these attempts be regarded as undermining the democracy of the affected countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we are going to analyze a great number of these russian tweets and look into their motivations for this meddling. We will mainly look into their overall political goals in the US, and examine how these goals change over time. Have the trolls achieved their goals? We will also look into how the trolls operate and organize themselves, trying to find patterns in the madness. Such patterns can hopefully help the general population to indicate that a tweet is originating from a troll. As the Russian efforts are increasing every year, a solution is needed to defend the democracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Research questions\n",
    "\n",
    "-Which themes does the propaganda mainly revolve around? About which issues should people be particularly careful not to believe everything they read?\n",
    "-Words\n",
    "-most common word\n",
    "-names\n",
    "-consensus\n",
    "-checking most common words in set above 3 characters (most common 4grams)\n",
    "\n",
    "-Does the trolls advocate for a common political stance in each specific country? If so which leaning do they have? If not, how polarized are the tweets between left leaning and right leaning?\n",
    "-groupby region, category\n",
    "\n",
    "-Were the trolls united with a common political leaning in the period after the primaries in the US elections?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-Was the original mission of the Russian trolls for the US election to make sure that Clinton was not elected, or to get Trump elected?\n",
    "\n",
    "-Are the trolls organized as a unit? Do they interact with each other (retweets, etc)?\n",
    "\n",
    "-Is there a way for people without a technical background to determine if a tweet is coming from a Russian troll?\n",

    "IRA russian twitter trolls - Three million tweets amounting to 175 Mb, along with a detailed description of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains around three million tweets and retweets from 2848 unique twitter users. Each tweet has several attributes, some of them are extracted from the tweet itself. For instance the author, content, and time stamp. Other attributes are later added. An example of such attributes is category of the troll, e.g. RightTroll, NewsFeed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many factors that we can examine in the dataset. Looking at given features like timing could be very interesting to find patterns. We also intend to add features, in order to make the dataset more suitable for our analysis. As every data point contains the whole tweet itself, it is possible to perform a broad analysis on the content. This could be used to determine whether a certain person or word is mentioned, and add the overall theming as a feature. Another example of a possible extra feature is stating whether a tweet is a retweet of another troll, unique, or identical to another tweet in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set it pretty small so it should be pretty manageable to process with pandas, but spark could also be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requierements\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task is to intimately acquaint yourself with the data, preprocess it and complete all the necessary descriptive statistics tasks. We expect you to have a pipeline in place, fully documented in a notebook, and show us that you’ve advanced with your understanding of the project goals by updating its README description.\n",
    "\n",
    "When describing the data, in particular, you should show (non-exhaustive list):\n",
    "\n",
    "- That you can handle the data in its size.\n",
    "- That you understand what’s into the data (formats, distributions, missing values, correlations, etc.).\n",
    "- That you considered ways to enrich, filter, transform the data according to your needs.\n",
    "- That you have updated your plan in a reasonable way, reflecting your improved knowledge after data acquaintance. In particular, discuss how your data suits your project needs and discuss the methods you’re going to use, giving their essential mathematical details in the notebook.\n",
    "- That your plan for analysis and communication is now reasonable and sound, potentially discussing alternatives to your choices that you considered but dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will evaluate this milestone according to how well these previous steps (or other reasonable ones) have been done and documented, the quality of the code and its documentation, the feasibility and critical awareness of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of second data set: \n",
    "\n",
    "- rus_troll_user.csv : Contains user specific features. (nickname, description field, follower count etc.)\n",
    "- rus_troll_tweet_text.csv: Contains text and language of the given tweet. You will use this if you are doing text classification, sentiment analysis, topic detection etc. \n",
    "- rus_troll_tweet_metadata.csv: Contains features that are user specific, but may change tweet to tweet.\n",
    "- rus_troll_tweet_stats.csv: Contains other (imo important) tweet features"

For Azerbaijan where the official language is Azerbaijani, a language that is close to russian, these tweets might be directed at the population. However, the population of UAE mainly speak Arabic, European and asian languages. The fact that so few tweets in this region are written in Arabic and English indicates that the tweets are meant for people outside of the region. Why the trolls follow this approach in this country is a mystery to us, and is something that we hope someone with knowledge about the Russian language will look into."

For instance, most of the tweets labeled to our mothertongue Norwegian was English. The same went for different languages, such as those of neighbouring countries like Danish and Swedish. For this reason we decide to discard all tweets in other languages than english, in order to avoid confusion. We could have included tweets in other languages of which we have some knowledge of, we decide not to as we have limited knowledge of the political climate in these countries. The labeling of english tweets are also better, and our decision also helps keeping the scope of the project limited."

After inspecting the english tweets from azerbaijan, we find that most tweets are retweets. We suspect this might be the case for the other non-english speaking countries. We therefore decide to plot a stacked bar chart to see how the distribution of the tweet types behave in different regions. We set a treshold of how many tweets originate from a country, in order to avoid countries with a very small amount of tweets."

    "**We see that the three english speaking countries Canada, UK and USA, all have more original tweets than retweets. Compare this to countries like Azerbaijan, Belarus and Iraq, we see that english retweets are far more prominent than original tweets. We do, however, see that there are other countries, that we expect to have been important targets, that have a much larger concentration of english original tweets. This is particularly true for Germany and Italy. We also note that a very high percentile of the tweets with unknown origin are original tweets. If unknown tweets are spread in a distribution close to the tweets with known origin, one would assume that an overwhelming majority of these tweets originates from the USA, and that the ratio of original tweets would be similar to that of the US. However the tweets with unknown origin have a way higher ratio of original tweets.** \n",
    "\n",
    "We hypothesize that original tweets are regarded as more influential to the audience of the tweet, and that the russians therefore prefer these in targeted countries with a high percentage of english speakers such as UK, USA and Germany. Retweets, on the other hand, can be a useful tool to push the retweet count of certain tweets up, in order to increase their legitimacy in the eyes of the viewer. What country these retweets come from does not matter, and it therefore makes sense that the retweet percentage is so high in contries like Azerbaijan and Russia. \n",
